# Test

Welcome to the ViolinCompetition! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/test`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation
Execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

You will be able to navigate easily through the app as you click through the links, forms and buttons. If you are still confused, feel free to refer to the video below to understand how the app can be utilized.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
